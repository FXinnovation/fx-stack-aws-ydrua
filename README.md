AWS You Dind't Remove User Access - Cloudformation Drift Detection System

## Description
This project aims to publish metrics in `Cloudwatch` about your stack's drift status. This will allow you to define custom alarms to be notified when one or multiple stacks have drifted.

Complete documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://scm.dazzlingwrench.fxinnovation.com/fxinnovation-public/lambda-aws-ydrua/wiki)

## Name
The name of the tool comes from the fact that the tool itself should not exist, because in an ideal world, you do not make changes manually to a stack, but then reality shifts in.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to the project, but please take notice we try to have full test coverage and to keep the code simple, readable and maintainable.
